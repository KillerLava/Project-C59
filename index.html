        <p id="first_para">My favourite hobby is cubing. I started cubing at the start of lockdown in early 2020. One of my friend was doing cubing so I thought I should learn. I can solve a cube in less than 20 seconds and my best time is 11 seconds. Cubing has many health benefits like it improves concentrataion, develops more advanced finger techniques and improves problem solving skills. I have participated in a "International cubing competition" and got 3rd prize in under 10 age group! I do cubing in my free time and I will always do cubing! Some of the cubers which I like are Feliks Zemdegs, Leo Borromeo and Tymon. There are more cubes than a standard 3X3 Rubik's cube. Some of them are 4X4, 5X5, 6X6, 7X7, pyraminx, megaminx, gigaminx, skewb, square 1, etc.</p>
